## Description ##

* Instant Feedback: Re-size the widget's images and see text as you type.
* Easy: Click the widget's "edit" link on your page. No need for admin menus. Move the widget or add a new one. 
* Flexible: Each widget can have an image, heading, text, and/or a link. One widget could be only an image and a link to your "Contact" page. Or only a heading, text, and a link to a blog post. 
* Responsive: Looks good at any size. Perfect for Bootstrap themes, where widgets can have most of the content. Use vector images for retina displays.
