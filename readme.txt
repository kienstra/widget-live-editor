A flexible widget, where you enter an image, a headline, copy, and a link. Resize the image, link to any page or post.

== Description ==

* Easy alignment: Re-size widget images, so that you can align widgets.
* Flexible: Each widget can have an image, heading, text, and/or a link. One widget could be only an image and a link to your "Contact" page. Or only a heading, text, and a link to a blog post.
* Responsive: Looks good at any size. Perfect for Bootstrap themes, where widgets can have most of the content. Use vector images for retina displays.
